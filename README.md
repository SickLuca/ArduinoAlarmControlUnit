# ArduinoAlarmControlUnit - Wokwi Simulation

This repository contains an Arduino-based project designed to run on the [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) simulation platform. It includes the complete source code and the necessary configuration files to simulate the hardware components used.

## Repository Contents

- **`sketch.ino`** – The main Arduino sketch containing the complete source code of the project.  
- **`diagram.json`** – The Wokwi configuration file that defines the circuit diagram and the components used in the simulation.

## How to Run the Project on Wokwi

1. Go to [https://wokwi.com/](https://wokwi.com/)
2. Click on **"Start from Example"** or **"New Project"**
3. Replace the default files with:
   - `sketch.ino` (replace the default `sketch.ino`)
   - `diagram.json` (upload this file to define the hardware layout)
4. Click **"Play"** to start the simulation.
